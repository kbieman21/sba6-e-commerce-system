## Reflection questions
# How you implemented TypeScript features and OOP principles.
I used vite to implement typescript features. In addition, I inherited Error class to build a custom error class that allow me to use the OOP principles.
# The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.
Some of the requirements were confusing. Especially when it comes to the discount and tax calculation functions. I had some challenges on overriding the functions in the base classes in the children classes/subclasses. As a result it took me long time to figure things out. At the end, I went by commen sense when calculating the discounts and tax amounts.
# How you handled asynchronous operations and error management.
for asynchronous operations I used the awit fetch function to communicate with the API. I also created a custom error classes that handles an API error and data error, so i have a clear customized error messages when there is an API or a data erros.
